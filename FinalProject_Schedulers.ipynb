    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of the project is to automate and optimally create a scheduler for a dining hall with 100 student workers each with a randomly generated class schedule while improving the schedule over time through deep learning. The data used is a csv file that contains a list of 100 students alongside their availability for every half hour in the day starting from 6:00 am to 11:30 pm. Initially, the solution involves creating a scheduler that assigns students to shifts based on the basic requirements. The scheduler eventually optimizes to meet the other constraints. The final schedule is saved to an excel file where it highlights when each student has a shift and the scheduler is measured based on how well it can stick to the constraints while also keeping the basic requirements."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The workforce scheduling problem (WSP) involves determining the optimal assignment of workers to various work periods while satisfying constraints such as labor laws and employee preferences<sup>([1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2333359_Workforce_Scheduling))</sup>. This problem is crucial in maximizing organizational efficiency and profitability without compromising staff well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSP has been a significant theme in operations research due to its broad applications in industries reliant on human capital, such as healthcare, public transportation, and customer service<sup>([2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46189793_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_Workforce_Scheduling_Problems))</sup>. These industries require efficient scheduling to ensure high service levels and operational efficiency. In the context of higher education, one application of the WSP can be found in assigning shifts for student workers at the dining hall. This setting presents unique challenges, such as students’ class schedules, ensuring adequate staffing in opening and closing shift hours, and preventing consecutive closing and opening shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has applied various algorithms and methodologies to address WSP. Techniques used for Constraint-Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are well-suited for handling the complex and diverse constraints typical of scheduling problems<sup>([3](http://eil2.mie.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/scheduling/papers/fox-ecai90.pdf))</sup>. Machine learning methods, particularly reinforcement learning, have also shown promise in dynamically adjusting schedules based on real-time data and learning from historical scheduling outcomes<sup>([4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827122001846))</sup>."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is an approximation of the needs of managers at the UCSD Sixth Market, where they have to assign shifts for student workers each week, based on their class schedules and a set of other constraints. Our goal is to create a tool that takes in a large dataset of student workers’ class schedules and outputs a realistic, fair, and efficient work shift schedule for a given facility. Specifically, the tool will be provided with 100 unique students and their weekly class schedules. It will need to organize a schedule such that at least 6 students are present in the facility at all open times (6am - 12 am), each shift is 4.5 hours long, each student works 3 or 4 shifts per week, and does not work more than 1 shift per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, this problem could be appropriately modeled as a CSP. The tool’s performance will be based on how well it abides by the above constraints, measured by its reward scores. We will determine the exact preferences in the process. We also plan to replicate its performance with a wide variety of student schedules to ensure that it is generalizable to new students.\n"
